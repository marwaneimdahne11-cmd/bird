## 🚀 Professional Workflow

### 1. Development
Install dependencies and launch the localized engine:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Version Control Pipeline
Always push to `main` to trigger the CI/CD checks:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: enhance brand aesthetics"
git push origin main
```

### 3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
Our automated pipeline ensures every push is stable:
- **Linting**: Enforces code quality and standard deviation design patterns.
- **Build**: Validates the production bundle before deployment.

## 📦 Deployment & Sync

This project is optimized for **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

1. **Connect GitHub**: Import your repository into the dashboard.
2. **Environment Variables**: Configure any `.env` keys in the dashboard.
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Every `git push` will automatically trigger a production deploy.

## 🔐 Security & Maintenance

- **.gitignore**: Strictly prevents leaking `node_modules`, `.next`, or local `.env` files.
- **Brand Assets**: Local images (bird1-bird9.jpg) are fully tracked for continuity.
- **Identity**: Ensure your git identity is configured to maintain accurate history.
